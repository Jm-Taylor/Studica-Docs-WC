 Local Build Instructions
 ========================

 Follow the instructions below to build the docs locally.

 Requirements
 ------------
 * `Python 3.9 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__
 
 Once Python is installed run the following command  
 `python -m pip install -r source/requirements.txt`

 Building
 --------

 Auto builder is the best solution to building the docs.  
 Run `make autobuild` in the root project folder.  
 This will create a live server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` or `localhost:8000`
