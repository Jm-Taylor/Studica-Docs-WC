Getting Started
===============

This documentation site can have quite a bit of information, and you may not know where to start. The getting started section will give you a better idea of the breakdown of each section and how to begin. 

WPILib for Java and C++
-----------------------

This section is the offically supported programming framework from Studica. Starting from this section as a beginner is recommended.  

Here, you will be able to:

- Download the framework
- Get vendor libraries
- Create Java or C++ projects
- Learn Autonmous basics
- Example project walkthroughs

HAL (Python, C++, Java)
-----------------------

This section focuses on low-level development directly on the VMX. Here, code is written to interact directly with the VMX HAL. Working here is more for advanced users creating their own framework or those looking to do Python. 

This section currently lacks much, as we plan to provide in-depth documentation that is not ready yet. 

ROS2 for VMX
------------

This section focuses on using the VMX with ROS2. We are creating a ROS2 Ubuntu image and ROS2 nodes for the VMX and Titan. 

VMX
---

This section contains all the images, interface guides, and documentation related to VMX use.

Titan
-----

This section contains the datasheet and programming instructions for the Titan. The programming app for updating the Titan is also included.

Sensors
-------

This section focuses on all the offical sensors compatible with the VMX and how to use them.

Actuators
---------

This section focuses on the acutators that are compatible with the VMX.

Control Station
---------------

A piece of software used to enable and disable the VMX robot. It can also be used to manually control the robot via joystick or gamepad inputs.
