            public final class Constants
            {
                /**
                 * Motor Constants
                 */
                public static final int TITAN_ID        = 42;
                public static final int MOTOR           = 2;
            }

- The constant ``TITAN_ID`` is the CAN ID for the Titan Quad. **Out of box the ID is 42**
- The constant ``MOTOR`` is the motor port on the Titan Quad that the motor is attached to. In this case that is M2.
