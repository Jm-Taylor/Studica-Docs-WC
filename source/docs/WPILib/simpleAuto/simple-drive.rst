SimpleDrive
===========

``SimpleDrive`` is the command that controls the subsystem output. Commands can be called again and again which makes them perfect for autonomous routines.

- Lines ``4`` - ``10`` are the imports required. 
- Line ``20`` grabs the instance of the ``DriveTrain`` subsystem defined and instantiated in ``RobotContainer``.
- Lines ``25`` - ``28`` are the constructor.
- Line ``27`` says that this command requires the subsystem ``drive`` which is the handle for the subsystem ``DriveTrain``.
- Lines ``33`` - ``37`` is the initialize section of the command. In this case there is nothing to initialize so it is left blank.
- Lines ``42`` - ``46`` is the execute section of the command. As long as the command is active anything in here will run every robot packet (20ms).
- Line ``45`` is setting the motor speed to ``0.5`` which is equal to ``50%`` speed. 
- Lines ``51`` - ``55`` is the end section of the command. When the command is scheduled to end or is interrupted this method is called. 
- Line ``54`` sets the motor speed to ``0.0`` this will stop the motor. **It is a good idea to always add a stop motor instruction here unless its not required**.
- Lines ``60`` - ``64`` is the isFinished section of the command. This method can be called to check if the command is finished or not. Useful if you wanted to put a stop condition based on sensor feedback here. For example using the sharp sensor to sence distance and it hits the threshold.
