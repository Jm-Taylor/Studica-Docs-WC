Adding Vendor Libraries
=======================

Adding a vendor library is simple. Open VS Code then the command palette using ``Ctrl + Shift + P`` or ``F1`` and type the following command ``WPILib: Manage Vendor Libraries``. A list of choices will be shown.

- *Manage current libraries* - Shows the currently installed libraries and allows removal of libraries.
- *Check for updates(offline)* - will check if there is an update for library in the offline folder.
- *Check for updates(online)* - will check if there is an update for a library online.
- *Install new libraries(offline)* - will install a new library in the offline folder.
- *Install new libraries(online)* - will install a new library from the internet. 

For the VMX all libraries are ``Install new libraries(online)``.

The are two current vendor libraries for the VMX.
